Great video on fingering for scales, very helpful

scaleSelacs move has been temporarily set to scaleSSelacs
This is because 8 notes on UI leaves the tonic of the next note and each shifts by one
it's ugly and confusing

Three options:
1) Leave as is, but add rest to the end
 - this is hard because I don't know how to handle the rest in animation
 - I also don't like the hard cut going from ascending to descending...

2) Revert to flow/stamina behavior for this mode (maybe with ascending scales being separate) -- and replace the old slice for max notes
 - this requires removing the (if floatyNotes.length === 8) shift behavior

3) Somehow figure out how to illustrate ascending and then descending, probably with colors in two stages?
 - maybe black to green to black, will illustrate "undoing" the scale
 - this has the benfit of setting us up for the next scale without apparent shift

// TODO add ghostnotes after, or invisible rests to the end of floatyNotes during reverse scale
// justification is off here, works well at 1-2 notes not so well at 6-8 notes. wobbles
